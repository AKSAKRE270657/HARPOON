            <p>“Firefighters probably won’t help,” says Dan Kraus, an arborist from Everett, Wash., who has rescued more
                than a thousand cats from trees. Give the cat at least 24 hours to dismount on its own before going up
                after it. When you do, wear a hard hat, a harness and boots. Stay safely tied to the tree either by a
                top
                rope you’ve looped over sturdy branches above or with two ropes secured around the trunk. To avoid
                spooking the cat, climb quietly, without breaking dead branches or yelling progress reports to onlookers
                below.</p>

            <p>
                Watch for signs you might be dealing with a jumper: Is the cat crawling dangerously far out on a branch,
                repeatedly looking at you and then down at the ground? In Kraus’s experience, about one in 15 cats will
                leap rather than be captured.

            <h2>WELES CORGI</h2>

            <P>Welsh corgi, either of two breeds of working dogs developed to handle cattle. They are similar in
                appearance
                but are of different origins. Their resemblance results from crosses between the two breeds.

                The Cardigan Welsh corgi (see photograph), named for Cardiganshire, can be traced back to dogs brought
                to
                Wales by the Celts about 1200 BC. </P>
            <p>The original type was known as the Bronant and was related to the
                progenitors of the dachshund. The Pembroke Welsh corgi (see photograph), of Pembrokeshire, is descended
                from dogs brought to Wales by Flemish weavers about AD 1100. The ancestors of the Pembroke belonged to
                the
                group that produced the Keeshond, Pomeranian, and Samoyed. The corgi gained exposure from its
                association
                with the royal family of Britain; Queen Elizabeth II has had corgis since her childhood.</P>

            <p>Penguin, (order Sphenisciformes), any of 18 species of flightless marine birds that live only in the
                Southern Hemisphere. The majority of the 18 species live not in Antarctica but rather between latitudes
                45°
                and 60° S, where they breed on islands. A few penguins inhabit temperate regions, and one, the Galapagos
                penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus), lives at the Equator.
            </p>
            <p>The stocky, short-legged appearance of penguins has endeared them to people worldwide. They range from
                about 35 cm
                (14 inches) in height and approximately 1 kg (about 2 pounds) in weight in the blue, or fairy, penguin
                (Eudyptula
                minor) to 115 cm (45 inches) and 25 to 40 kg (55 to 90 pounds) in the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes
                forsteri). Most
                are black on the back and white below, often with lines of black across the upper breast or spots of
                white on the
                head. Colour is rare, being limited to red or yellow irises of the eye in some species; red beaks or
                feet in a few;
                yellow brow tufts in the three species of Eudyptes; and orange and yellow on the head, neck, and breast
                in the
                emperor and king (A. patagonica) penguins.</p>
